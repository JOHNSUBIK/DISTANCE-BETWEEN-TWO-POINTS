# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Replace the values with the coordinates of your two points
### Step 2: 
The program will calculate and print the distance between them 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Use the math function
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program for Distance between two points
#Name :John Paul.J
#Register number:23011778
import math
x1,x2,y1,y2=10,4,6,2
dis=math.sqrt((pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2)))
print(round(dis,2))
```
